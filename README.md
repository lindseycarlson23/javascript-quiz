# **JavaScript Quiz**

## **Project Overview**

For this project, I wrote a JavaScript Quiz game utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is timed and allows the user to click through multiple choice questions, keep track of the number of correct answers and deducting 10 seconds for each incorrect answer. Once complete, the user enters their initials and view their score.

This project introduced me to Web APIs, the DOM, styling and setting element attributes from JS, intervals and timers, event listeners, local storage, and data attributes.
